## Key Concepts

Reflect on your understanding of these core PLC concepts:

**Basic Logic Operations:**
- How did you implement AND, OR, and XOR logic using ladder logic contacts (series, parallel, combinations)?

**PLC vs. Microcontroller:**
- Based on your experience with both Arduino (Project 1) and PLCs, what are the key differences in how they're programmed and used?

**Ladder Logic:**
- Why is ladder logic used in industrial control instead of languages like C++ or Python?

**Memory and State:**
- How do internal control relays allow a PLC to "remember" state? How is this different from direct control?

**Timers:**
- What types of timer behavior did you observe? How do timers enable time-based control?

**Industrial Applications:**
- How does PLC programming relate to robotics and automation? Where would you use a PLC vs. a microcontroller?
