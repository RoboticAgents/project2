## Technical Reflection

### Lab 0: Logic Fundamentals (AND, OR, XOR)

**What did Lab 0 demonstrate?**
Explain what you learned about basic logic operations in ladder logic, how series and parallel contacts work, and how to implement AND, OR, and XOR logic.

**Challenges encountered:**


**How did you implement XOR logic?**


### Lab 2: Direct Control (No Memory)

**What did Lab 2 demonstrate?**
Explain the concept of direct input-to-output control and what you learned about immediate cause-and-effect behavior in PLCs.

**What customization did you implement?**


**Challenges encountered:**


### Lab 3: Start/Stop Control with Memory

**What does Lab 3 add conceptually?**
Explain how memory changes the system behavior, what internal control relays do, and how latching/sealing logic works.

**What customization did you implement?**


**Challenges encountered:**


### Lab 4: Timers and Time-Based Behavior

**How do timers change system behavior?**
Explain what timers enable in PLC systems, how they differ from immediate logic, and why they're important for real-world applications.

**What timer behavior did you implement?**


**What customization did you implement?**


**Challenges encountered:**
